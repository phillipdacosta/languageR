# Availability Viewer Bug Fix - Cancelled Classes Blocking Slots 🐛

## Problem
**User Report**: "The time slots is still showing as unavailable in the tutor/:id page... after the class cancelled for the class occupying the slots..."

## Root Cause
In `tutor-availability-viewer.component.ts`, the `loadBookedLessons()` method was hardcoding the status of classes to `'scheduled'`:

```typescript
// LINE 310 - THE BUG:
const classesAsLessons = classesResponse.classes.map((cls: any) => ({
  startTime: cls.startTime,
  endTime: cls.endTime,
  status: 'scheduled', // ❌ HARDCODED - ignores actual status!
  _id: cls._id,
  subject: cls.name
}));
```

Then, `buildBookedSlotsSet()` only skips lessons with `status !== 'scheduled'`:

```typescript
// LINE 363:
if (lesson.status !== 'scheduled' && lesson.status !== 'in_progress') {
  console.log(`⏭️ Skipping lesson with status: ${lesson.status}`);
  skippedCount++;
  continue;
}
```

**Result**: Even though the class was cancelled in the database, it was converted to a "lesson" with `status: 'scheduled'`, so it passed the filter and continued to block the time slot.

## The Fix

### Changed File:
`language-learning-app/src/app/components/tutor-availability-viewer/tutor-availability-viewer.component.ts`

**Before** (lines 297-318):
```typescript
// Convert classes to lesson-like format for processing
if (classesResponse.success && classesResponse.classes) {
  console.log(`🎓 Classes loaded: ${classesResponse.classes.length} total`);
  classesResponse.classes.forEach((c: any, index: number) => {
    console.log(`  Class ${index + 1}: ${c.name}`);
    console.log(`    Start: ${c.startTime}`);
    console.log(`    End: ${c.endTime}`);
    console.log(`    Start Date: ${new Date(c.startTime).toLocaleString()}`);
    console.log(`    End Date: ${new Date(c.endTime).toLocaleString()}`);
  });
  const classesAsLessons = classesResponse.classes.map((cls: any) => ({
    startTime: cls.startTime,
    endTime: cls.endTime,
    status: 'scheduled', // ❌ Classes are scheduled events
    _id: cls._id,
    subject: cls.name
  }));
  console.log(`🎓 Converted ${classesAsLessons.length} classes to lesson format`);
  allBookedSlots.push(...classesAsLessons);
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Convert classes to lesson-like format for processing
if (classesResponse.success && classesResponse.classes) {
  console.log(`🎓 Classes loaded: ${classesResponse.classes.length} total`);
  
  // Filter out cancelled classes - they shouldn't block availability
  const activeClasses = classesResponse.classes.filter((cls: any) => cls.status !== 'cancelled');
  console.log(`🎓 Active (non-cancelled) classes: ${activeClasses.length} of ${classesResponse.classes.length}`);
  
  activeClasses.forEach((c: any, index: number) => {
    console.log(`  Class ${index + 1}: ${c.name} (status: ${c.status})`);
    console.log(`    Start: ${c.startTime}`);
    console.log(`    End: ${c.endTime}`);
    console.log(`    Start Date: ${new Date(c.startTime).toLocaleString()}`);
    console.log(`    End Date: ${new Date(c.endTime).toLocaleString()}`);
  });
  
  const classesAsLessons = activeClasses.map((cls: any) => ({
    startTime: cls.startTime,
    endTime: cls.endTime,
    status: cls.status || 'scheduled', // ✅ Preserve actual status
    _id: cls._id,
    subject: cls.name
  }));
  console.log(`🎓 Converted ${classesAsLessons.length} active classes to lesson format`);
  allBookedSlots.push(...classesAsLessons);
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Filter cancelled classes** before converting: `cls.status !== 'cancelled'`
2. **Preserve actual status**: `status: cls.status || 'scheduled'` instead of hardcoding
3. **Better logging**: Shows how many cancelled vs active classes were found

## Data Flow (After Fix)

```
Auto-Cancel Triggered
       ↓
Class status set to 'cancelled' in DB
       ↓
Backend saves class with status='cancelled'
       ↓
[User refreshes /tutor/:id page]
       ↓
loadBookedLessons() called
       ↓
Fetches all classes from API
       ↓
✅ Filters out classes with status='cancelled'
       ↓
Only active classes converted to "lesson format"
       ↓
buildBookedSlotsSet() processes only active classes
       ↓
Cancelled class time slots NOT added to bookedSlots Set
       ↓
precomputeDateSlots() shows those slots as AVAILABLE ✅
```

## Expected Behavior (After Fix)

### Test Scenario:
1. **Class exists** at Wednesday 2:00 PM
2. **Navigate to `/tutor/:id`** page
   - Wed 2:00 PM slot: **BOOKED** (gray) ✅
3. **Auto-cancel the class** (test button or cron)
4. **Refresh `/tutor/:id` page** (F5 or navigate away and back)
   - Wed 2:00 PM slot: **AVAILABLE** (green, clickable) ✅✅✅

### Backend Logs (After Fix):
```
🎓 Classes loaded: 5 total
🎓 Active (non-cancelled) classes: 4 of 5
  Class 1: Spanish 101 (status: scheduled)
  Class 2: English Conversation (status: scheduled)
  Class 3: French Basics (status: scheduled)
  Class 4: German Advanced (status: scheduled)
🎓 Converted 4 active classes to lesson format
📊 Total booked slots to process: 8
  (4 active classes + 4 lessons = 8)
```

Note: The cancelled class is filtered out and doesn't appear in the logs or block any slots.

## Why This Bug Existed

The original code was probably written before class cancellation was implemented. At that time, all classes in the database were assumed to be "scheduled", so hardcoding the status didn't cause issues.

When the cancellation feature was added:
- Classes could have `status: 'cancelled'`
- But the availability viewer wasn't updated to handle this
- It continued to treat ALL classes as scheduled

## Related Issues Prevented by This Fix

This fix also prevents:
1. **Completed classes** from blocking slots (if you add that status later)
2. **Deleted classes** that might still be in the DB with a special status
3. Any future statuses that shouldn't block availability

The filter `cls.status !== 'cancelled'` is explicit and future-proof.

## Files Modified
- ✅ `language-learning-app/src/app/components/tutor-availability-viewer/tutor-availability-viewer.component.ts`
  - Line ~297-325: `loadBookedLessons()` method
  - Added filter for cancelled classes
  - Preserved actual class status instead of hardcoding

## Testing

### Manual Test:
1. Open tutor-calendar
2. Click "TEST Auto-Cancel" on a future class
3. Wait for success toast
4. Navigate to `/tutor/:id` page (replace `id` with your tutor ID)
5. **Look at the time slot** where the cancelled class was
6. **Expected**: Slot should be **green/clickable** (available) ✅
7. **Check console** for logs:
   ```
   🎓 Active (non-cancelled) classes: X of Y
   ```
   Where Y > X (meaning at least one was filtered out)

### Before Fix:
- Cancelled class counted as booked
- Slot remained gray (unavailable)
- Students couldn't book that time

### After Fix:
- Cancelled class filtered out
- Slot shows as available
- Students can book that time ✅
