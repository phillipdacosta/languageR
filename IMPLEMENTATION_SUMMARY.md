---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Configure Stripe (Required)

Add to `/Users/phillipdacosta/language-app/backend/.env`:

```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_key_here
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_key_here
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:8100
```

Get keys from: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys

### 2. Test Backend Endpoints

```bash
# Test wallet balance (should return 401 without auth)
curl http://localhost:3000/api/wallet/balance

# Test with auth token:
curl http://localhost:3000/api/wallet/balance \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH0_TOKEN"
```

### 3. Frontend Implementation

Build UI components:
- **Wallet Page** - Balance display, top-up button
- **Booking Flow** - Payment method selection (wallet vs card)
- **Tutor Dashboard** - Stripe Connect onboarding
- **Payment History** - Transaction list

See `PAYMENT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` for code examples!

## 💰 Money Flow Example

**Lesson Price: $25**

1. **Booking (Authorization)**
   - Student chooses wallet payment
   - `reservedBalance += $25`
   - Lesson status: `billingStatus: 'authorized'`

2. **Lesson Happens**
   - Video call occurs
   - Recording, transcription, analysis

3. **Lesson Completion (Capture)**
   - Call ends → `/api/lessons/:id/call-end`
   - Triggers `paymentService.completeLessonPayment()`
   - **Wallet deduction**: `balance -= $25`, `reservedBalance -= $25`
   - **Tutor payout**: Transfer $21.25 (85%) via Stripe Connect
   - **Platform fee**: Keep $3.75 (15%) as revenue
   - Lesson status: `billingStatus: 'charged'`, `revenueRecognized: true`

   - Filter by type, date, status
   - Download receipts

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Stripe is not configured"

**Solution**: Add `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` to `backend/.env`

### "Insufficient wallet balance"

**Cause**: `availableBalance` is less than lesson price  
**Solution**: Check `reservedBalance` - funds might be locked for pending lessons

### "Transfer to tutor failed"

**Cause**: Tutor hasn't completed Stripe Connect onboarding  
**Solution**: Check `GET /api/payments/stripe-connect/status`

### Backend won't start

**Check**:
```bash
tail -50 /tmp/backend-payment.log
```

**Common issues**:
- Port 3000 already in use → Kill process: `lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9`
- MongoDB not running → Start MongoDB
- Missing env vars → Check `.env` file
