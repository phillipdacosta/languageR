# GCS Permission Error Fixed - Pronunciation Now Working

**Date:** Dec 11, 2025  
**Lesson ID:** `693af1457bdc33b8eba10a0c`  
**Issue:** Pronunciation data not generated  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## Problem Summary

Pronunciation assessment failed with GCS permission errors:
```
❌ Failed to download from GCS: gs://languager-videos-2025/audio/693af1457bdc33b8eba10a0c/segment-5.webm
Anonymous caller does not have storage.objects.get access to the Google Cloud Storage object.
Permission 'storage.objects.get' denied on resource (or it may not exist).
```

### Timeline:
1. ✅ Audio uploaded to GCS successfully during lesson
2. ✅ Transcription completed (26 segments)
3. ✅ Grammar/fluency analysis completed (B2 level)
4. ✅ Sampled 4/26 segments for pronunciation (15%)
5. ❌ **Failed to download audio from GCS** - Anonymous caller error
6. ❌ No pronunciation assessment could run

---

## Root Cause

In `/backend/routes/transcription.js` line 989, the GCS Storage client was initialized **without proper authentication**:

```javascript
// ❌ OLD - Missing credentials
const storage = new Storage({ projectId: process.env.GCP_PROJECT_ID });
```

This created an "anonymous caller" that couldn't read files from the bucket.

---

## Fix Applied

Updated the Storage client initialization to include proper credentials (same config as `gcs.js`):

```javascript
// ✅ NEW - With credentials
const storageConfig = {
  projectId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID,
};

// For local development, use key file
if (process.env.GOOGLE_CLOUD_KEY_FILE) {
  storageConfig.keyFilename = process.env.GOOGLE_CLOUD_KEY_FILE;
}
// For cloud deployment (Render), use JSON credentials
else if (process.env.GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON) {
  storageConfig.credentials = JSON.parse(process.env.GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON);
}

const storage = new Storage(storageConfig);
```

   Words to improve: 5

   Top words:
     - necesitaba (70/100): The stress on the second syllable 'si' was slightly off
     - proyecto (72/100): The 'y' sound could be smoother and more fluid
     - suficientes (68/100): The 'ci' sound was not fully clear
     - esperándola (74/100): The nasal 'n' and stress on 'rán' could be more distinct
     - empleados (70/100): The 'ple' sound was a bit rushed
```
