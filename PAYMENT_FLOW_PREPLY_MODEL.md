## 📝 **Files Modified**

### 1. **Payment Service** (`backend/services/paymentService.js`)

#### **NEW METHOD: `deductLessonFunds()`**
```javascript
/**
 * Deduct funds when lesson STARTS (Preply model)
 * Called when lesson transitions to 'in_progress' status
 */
async deductLessonFunds(lessonId) {
  // Check if already deducted (idempotent)
  if (payment.chargedAt) {
    return; // Already charged
  }
  
  // Deduct from wallet
  if (paymentMethod === 'wallet') {
    await walletService.deductFunds({...});
  }
  
  // Mark as charged
  payment.chargedAt = new Date();
  lesson.billingStatus = 'charged';
}
```

#### **UPDATED METHOD: `completeLessonPayment()`**
```javascript
// Now SKIPS wallet deduction (already happened at start)
// Only handles:
// 1. Tutor payout via Stripe Connect
// 2. Platform fee revenue recognition
```

---

### 2. **Lesson Routes** (`backend/routes/lessons.js`)

#### **UPDATED: `POST /api/lessons/:id/call-start`**
```javascript
router.post('/:id/call-start', verifyToken, async (req, res) => {
  lesson.actualCallStartTime = new Date();
  lesson.status = 'in_progress';
  
  // 💰 NEW: Deduct funds when lesson starts
  if (lesson.paymentId) {
    await paymentService.deductLessonFunds(lesson._id);
    console.log(`✅ Funds deducted at START`);
  }
});
```

---

### 3. **Payment Model** (`backend/models/Payment.js`)

#### **NEW FIELD: `chargedAt`**
```javascript
{
  chargedAt: Date, // When funds were actually charged
  // Set when lesson starts (Preply model)
}
```

### **For Platform:**

## 🛡️ **Safety Features**

### **1. Idempotent (Can't Charge Twice)**
```javascript
if (payment.chargedAt) {
  return; // Already charged, skip
}
```

### **2. Fallback Protection**
```javascript
// If deduction at START failed, will try at END
if (paymentMethod === 'wallet' && !payment.chargedAt) {
  await walletService.deductFunds({...}); // Fallback
}
```

### **3. Error Handling**
```javascript
try {
  await paymentService.deductLessonFunds(lesson._id);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to deduct funds at start');
  // Lesson continues - will try again at end
}
```
