# Video Compression Guide

## Why Compress Videos?

Large video files (400MB+) cause several problems:
- **Slow uploads** (minutes instead of seconds)
- **Poor playback performance** (buffering, stuttering)
- **High bandwidth usage** (expensive for users)
- **Storage costs** (expensive for the platform)

## Recommended Video Settings

For introduction videos, use these settings:

### **Resolution**: 1280x720 (720p) or 1920x1080 (1080p)
- Higher resolution = larger file size
- 720p is usually sufficient for introduction videos

### **Frame Rate**: 30fps
- Higher frame rate = larger file size
- 30fps provides smooth playback

### **Bitrate**: 2-5 Mbps
- Lower bitrate = smaller file size
- 2-3 Mbps is good for talking head videos

### **Duration**: 1-3 minutes
- Keep introduction videos concise
- Focus on key points: name, experience, teaching style

## Target File Sizes

| Duration | Target Size | Quality |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| 1 minute | 10-20MB | Good |
| 2 minutes | 20-40MB | Good |
| 3 minutes | 30-60MB | Good |
| 5 minutes | 50-100MB | Acceptable |

## Quick Tips

1. **Record in good lighting** - reduces noise, allows lower bitrate
2. **Use a good microphone** - audio quality matters more than video
3. **Keep background simple** - reduces compression artifacts
4. **Test playback** - always check compressed video before uploading

## What Happens If You Upload Large Files?

- ✅ **Files under 50MB**: Fast upload, smooth playback
- ⚠️ **Files 50-200MB**: Slower upload, may buffer occasionally  
- ❌ **Files over 200MB**: Very slow upload, poor playback experience
