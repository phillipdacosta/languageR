## Quick Debug Tips

### Modal doesn't appear?
Check console for:
```
🚪 VideoCall: Triggering early exit modal...
🚪 AppComponent: Early exit triggered, showing modal
```

### Analysis page shows error?
Check:
- Lesson was finalized (call-end endpoint called)
- Backend is running
- No 404 or 403 errors in network tab

### Can't rejoin?
Check query params in URL:
```
/pre-call?lessonId=XXX&role=student&lessonMode=true
```

### Confirmation doesn't work?
Check console for errors - likely AlertController issue

## Browser Console Commands

### Check if lesson is finalized:
```javascript
// In browser console
localStorage.getItem('currentLesson')
```

### Manually trigger early exit modal:
```javascript
// In browser console (after injecting service)
// This is for debugging only
```

## Expected Backend Behavior

When "End Lesson" is clicked:
1. `POST /api/lessons/:id/call-end` called
2. Response: `{ success: true, actualCallEndTime: "...", actualDurationMinutes: X }`
3. After 3 seconds, analysis auto-generated
4. Notification created for student

## Common Issues

### Issue: Modal appears for on-time exit
**Cause:** Time check logic inverted
**Fix:** Verify `isPermanentEnd` calculation in `endCall()`

### Issue: Analysis doesn't generate
**Cause:** call-end endpoint not called
**Fix:** Check network tab, verify endpoint returns success

### Issue: Modal appears on wrong page
**Cause:** setTimeout delay too short
**Fix:** Increase from 300ms to 500ms

### Issue: Multiple modals stack
**Cause:** User clicked "End Call" multiple times
**Fix:** Add debouncing or disable button after first click

## Success Criteria

All tests pass if:
- ✅ Modal appears only for early exits
- ✅ All 4 options work correctly
- ✅ Confirmation dialog works
- ✅ Analysis generated when appropriate
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Smooth UX, no flashing/jumping

## Performance Notes

- Modal creation: ~50ms
- Navigation to analysis: ~200ms
- Analysis generation: ~3 seconds
- Total early exit flow: ~3.5 seconds
