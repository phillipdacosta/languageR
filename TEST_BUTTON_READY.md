# Test Auto-Cancel Button - READY TO TEST! 🎉

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### Frontend Changes
- **Button Added**: Red "TEST Auto-Cancel" button appears on tutor home page (bottom-right)
- **Location**: `/language-learning-app/src/app/tab1/tab1.page.html` line ~17-23
- **Logic**: `/language-learning-app/src/app/tab1/tab1.page.ts` 
  - `testAutoCancelClass()` method (finds first scheduled class, shows confirmation)
  - `executeTestAutoCancel()` method (calls API, handles response)

### Backend Endpoint
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/classes/:classId/test-auto-cancel`
- **Location**: `/backend/routes/classes.js` lines 1449-1609
- **Status**: ✅ Already implemented and working!

## How to Test

### 1. Setup
```bash
# Backend should be running on port 3000
# Frontend should be running on port 8100
# You should be logged in as a tutor
```

### 2. Create a Test Class
1. Go to "Create Class" page
2. Create a class with:
   - Name: "Test Auto-Cancel Class"
   - Start time: Any future time (doesn't matter, button works immediately)
   - Minimum students: 2 (or any number)
   - Don't add enough students to meet minimum
   - Status should be 'scheduled'

### 3. Trigger Test Auto-Cancel
1. Go to **Tutor Home** page (`/tab1`)
2. Look for the **red "TEST Auto-Cancel"** button at bottom-right
3. Click the button
4. You should see an **alert** with the class name
5. Click **"Test Cancel"** to confirm
6. Wait for the loading indicator

### 4. Expected Results

#### Immediate Effects:
- ✅ Success toast: "✅ 'Class Name' test cancelled successfully"
- ✅ Notification badge updates
- ✅ "Cancelled" tab appears (if it wasn't there before)
- ✅ View switches to "Cancelled" tab automatically

#### On Tutor Home Page (`/tab1`):
- ✅ Class moves from "Upcoming Lessons" to "Cancelled" section
- ✅ Card shows "Cancelled" label
- ✅ Cancellation reason: "Cancelled due to insufficient enrollment"
- ⚠️ **Known Issue**: Card may appear in timeline view instead of card format (Issue #1 to fix)

#### On Tutor Calendar (`/tutor-calendar`):
- ⚠️ **Known Issue**: Class may disappear instead of showing crossed out (Issue #2 to fix)
- Should refresh automatically via WebSocket
- After manual page refresh, should see class crossed out

#### On Tutor Availability Viewer:
- ✅ Time slot becomes available again
- May need to refresh page to see the change

#### Notifications:
- ✅ Tutor receives notification: "Class Auto-Cancelled (TEST)"
- ✅ All confirmed students receive notification: "Class Cancelled (TEST)"
- ✅ Notifications include "(TEST MODE)" label

#### Backend Logs:
```
🧪 [TEST] Manually triggering auto-cancel for class: <Class Name>
🧪 [TEST] Class status updated to cancelled
🧪 [TEST] Removed <N> availability block(s)
🧪 [TEST] Notification created for tutor
🧪 [TEST] WebSocket notification sent to tutor
🧪 [TEST] WebSocket notification sent to student <Student Name>
```

#### Database Changes:
- ✅ Class status: `cancelled`
- ✅ Class cancelReason: `minimum_not_met`
- ✅ Class cancelledAt: current timestamp
- ✅ Tutor's availability array: class block removed
- ✅ Notifications created for tutor and students

## Technical Details

### API Request
```javascript
POST http://localhost:3000/api/classes/:classId/test-auto-cancel
Headers:
  Authorization: Bearer <token>
  Content-Type: application/json
```

### API Response (Success)
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Class \"Test Class\" cancelled successfully (TEST MODE)",
  "class": {
    "_id": "...",
    "name": "Test Class",
    "status": "cancelled",
    "cancelReason": "minimum_not_met",
    "cancelledAt": "2025-12-19T...",
    ...
  }
}
```

### API Response (Error)
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error message"
}
```

### WebSocket Event
```javascript
{
  type: 'class_auto_cancelled',
  title: 'Class Auto-Cancelled (TEST)',
  message: 'Your class "..." has been automatically cancelled (TEST MODE).',
  data: {
    classId: '...',
    className: '...',
    startTime: '...',
    minStudents: 2,
    confirmedCount: 0,
    isTest: true
  }
}
```

## Known Issues to Fix

### Issue #1: Tab1 (Tutor Home) - Card Format
**Problem**: When auto-cancel triggers, the cancelled class appears in timeline view instead of staying in the "Upcoming Lessons" card format.

**Expected**: If the class was in "Upcoming Lessons" section before cancellation, it should remain in card format when "Cancelled" tab is active.

**Files to Fix**:
- `language-learning-app/src/app/tab1/tab1.page.html`
- `language-learning-app/src/app/tab1/tab1.page.ts`

### Issue #2: Tutor Calendar - Crossed Out Display
**Problem**: Cancelled classes disappear from the calendar instead of showing crossed out.

**Expected**: Cancelled classes should remain visible but with crossed-out styling (the CSS already exists with `.is-cancelled` class).

**Files to Fix**:
- `language-learning-app/src/app/tutor-calendar/tutor-calendar.page.ts` (likely filtering out cancelled events)
- Calendar event building logic needs to set `isCancelled: true` on events

## Testing Checklist

## Troubleshooting

### Button Not Appearing
- Check if logged in as tutor (`currentUser?.userType === 'tutor'`)
- Check browser console for errors
- Clear browser cache and refresh

### Alert Shows "No upcoming scheduled classes"
- Create a class first
- Ensure class status is 'scheduled', not 'cancelled' or 'completed'
- Ensure class start time is in the future

### API Call Fails
- Check backend is running on port 3000
- Check browser network tab for request details
- Check backend logs for errors
- Verify auth token is valid

### WebSocket Not Working
- Check if connected to WebSocket (look for connection logs)
- Refresh page to reconnect
- Check `connectedUsers` Map in backend

### Notifications Not Appearing
- Check notification service is running
- Check WebSocket connection
- Check backend logs for notification creation
- Manually query database for notifications

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Test the button** - Use checklist above
2. 🔧 **Fix Issue #1** - Keep cancelled classes in card format on Tab1
3. 🔧 **Fix Issue #2** - Show crossed-out cancelled classes on calendar
4. 🧹 **Clean up** - Consider removing or protecting test button for production
